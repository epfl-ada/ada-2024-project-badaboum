## Project Proposal

### Abstract
This project explores the relationship between Oscar-winning films and audience ratings to assess the alignment (or divergence) between the Academy’s choices and public opinion. We will analyze IMDb ratings of Oscar winners, non-winning nominees, and box-office hits to uncover any trends or biases in Academy Awards decisions over time. Additionally, we aim to examine the influence of star power, genre, and the "Oscar bump" effect on ratings, as well as compare Oscars to other international film festivals. Through visualizations and statistical measures, this research will reveal patterns in Oscar nominations and wins, contributing to discussions on cultural and rating biases.
